### Personal Statement

The word "interdisciplinary" has become a buzzword in modern academia, used to describe so many different things that it now carries very little information. This is unfortunate, because the ideal of interdisciplinary research -- at its best, the intellectual cross-pollination of separate, but related fields -- is one worth pursuing, especially in young fields like neuroscience. One of the unique personal experiences that I think I can bring to my research is my relatively unorthodox academic path, which has exposed me to a number of different academic disciplines that all affect the way I think about neuroscience.

When I arrived at Princeton at the beginning of my freshman year, I didn't know what I wanted to study. This wasn't due to a lack of interest in any of the available majors, but the opposite: I was seriously interested in math, computer science, and philosophy, and Princeton unfortunately doesn't allow students to major in more than one department. For my first two years in college, I took classes in all three of these subjects, and, slightly to the detriment of my grades, satisfied the prerequisites for all three majors. At the beginning of my junior year, after spending the summer working in a machine learning lab and seriously thinking about what I wanted to study, I came to the conclusion that, while the abstract nature of computer science, math, and philosophy made them enjoyable to learn, it also made them harder to get genuinely curious about. I wanted to study the physical world, as messy and inelegant as it might be. When it came to doing research, my real area of interest was the natural sciences. Because the computer science department offered me the most opportunity to get involved in applied research, I chose to major in computer science.

During my junior year, I started doing my independent work with Prof. Jonathan Pillow, who works in computational neuroscience. I ended up doing a small independent work project in the spring of my junior year, then doing my thesis project with him during my senior year, and working as a research assistant in his lab the summer after graduation. It would be hard to overstate the effect that this experience had on my academic direction. In computational neuroscience, I found a way to apply my knowledge of probability and my experience with computer science to questions that I was genuinely curious about. This was the exact type of mathematical modeling that I had always wanted to do: work on the messy interface between the formal language of mathematics and the world of experimental data. 

For a year and a half after graduating, I worked as a software engineer on the Artificial Intelligence team at Bloomberg L.P., in New York. Although I had doubts about whether I would like working on the industry side of machine learning, I felt it was at least worth exploring. During the time that I worked there, I spent a lot of my free time learning about neuroscience and statistics. First, I took Adrienne Fairhall and Rajesh Rao's online course on computational neuroscience through Coursera and read Bill Lytton's introductory textbook, "From Computer to Brain" to get a broad survey of the field. Then, I sought out and read papers in the subfields I was interested in, memory and neural coding. One of the papers I especially liked was from Prof. Cristina Savin's lab at NYU, so, this May, I reached out to Prof. Savin and was able to join her lab full-time as a research assistant. 

Working in Prof. Savin's lab has solidified my belief that neuroscience is the field I want to work in, but it has also showed me how my past experience in other disciplines can help me as a neuroscientist. My background in math, for example, is very helpful for working with some of the models that we use to describe neural circuits. Knowledge of multiple programming languages, and experience programming in an industrial setting helps me efficiently set up data analyses and numerical simulations. Even my study of philosophy has proved helpful -- in a young field like neuroscience, philosophical questions like what makes two theories equivalent and what constitutes a testable hypothesis are still being sorted out. While I am pursuing my PhD, I hope to use my background in these fields to inform my research.
