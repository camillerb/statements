### Personal Statement

The word "interdisciplinary" might be somewhat overused in the academy today, but neuroscience is a field where its original meaning certainly applies. The field is made up of investigators from disciplines as different as molecular biology, physics, and computer science, all working on the same fundamental questions, with vastly different tools. Before settling on neuroscience and deciding to apply for a PhD, I spent time exploring a number of other academic disciplines, trying to figure out exactly what I wanted to do. While this has left me with less direct experience with neuroscience at this point than I would have liked, it has also exposed me to a number of different ways of thinking, which I believe will help me as a researcher.

When I arrived at Princeton at the beginning of my freshman year, I didn't know what I wanted to study. This wasn't due to a lack of interest in any of the available majors, but the opposite: I was seriously interested in math, computer science, and philosophy. For my first two years in college, I took classes in all three of these subjects, and satisfied the prerequisites for all three majors. This, however, came at a cost. Going into my junior year, my grades weren't what I wanted them to be, and, while I was still excited about the idea of doing research, I still hadn't found a field that I wanted to focus in.

One of the main reasons why I ultimately chose to major in computer science was because of the opportunities the department offered for students to do independent research with faculty in related fields. In the spring of my junior year, I started doing independent work with Prof. Jonathan Pillow, who works in computational neuroscience. This work continued for the rest of my time at Princeton, and culminated in my undergraduate thesis. It would be hard to overstate the effect that this experience had on my academic direction. In computational neuroscience, I found a way to apply my knowledge of probability and computing to questions that I was genuinely curious about. I also felt like, for the first time since coming to Princeton, I had hit my academic stride. Before, I had been very self-conscious of the fact that, despite seeing myself as an intellectually curious person, I had been unable to perform very well in my classes. In neuroscience research, I found something I was able to really excel at.

After graduating, I took a job as a software engineer at Bloomberg L.P. in New York, because I felt that the industry side of machine learning was worth exploring. Although I did learn a lot about how to build and maintain large software systems, I immediately missed neuroscience, and I set out to continue learning about the discipline on my own. I got a membership to NYU's Bobst library, where I would go for hours after work to study. First, to get a broad survey of computational neuroscience, I took an online course through Coursera, and read an introductory textbook. Neural coding and memory were the subfields that I was most interested in, so I started reading papers on these subjects, and coding up models to get a better understanding of them. One of the papers I especially liked was from Prof. Cristina Savin's lab at NYU, so, this May, I reached out to Prof. Savin and was able to join her lab full-time as a research assistant.

Working in Prof. Savin's lab has solidified my belief that neuroscience is the field I want to work in, but it has also showed me how my past experience in other disciplines can help me as a neuroscientist. My background in math, for example, is very helpful for working with some of the models that we use to describe neural circuits. Knowledge of multiple programming languages, and experience programming in an industrial setting helps me efficiently set up data analyses and numerical simulations. Even my study of philosophy has proved helpful -- in a young field like neuroscience, philosophical questions like what makes two theories equivalent and what constitutes a testable hypothesis are still being sorted out. While I am pursuing my PhD, I hope to use my background in each of these fields to inform my research.
